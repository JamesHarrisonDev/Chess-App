# Chess-App
A small chess application made for my AQA A-Level Computer Science NEA (coursework). The program is made using windows forms. The primary features include a login system, stats page, playable chess, AI opponent (using the minimax algorithm), random puzzle board generation and the ability to adjourn boards and resume them at later dates. User details and stats are stored using a local sql database.
